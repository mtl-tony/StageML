# StagedML
ML algorithms are constantly used for Supervised learning problems in both regression and classification. 

There is constantly have a tradeoff of interpretability vs performance. I want to have a model architecture in which this tradeoff can be accurately measured as we iteratively train up from fully interpretable models to fully complex models. This model can also be fit in stages and in different subsets of the data to ensure certain features can be seen first.
